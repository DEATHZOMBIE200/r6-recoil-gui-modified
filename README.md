This is my edited version of the recoil macro made by HighSkai, https://github.com/HighSkai/r6-recoil-gui

Changed:
1) Added a scope check option to only reduce recoil while right click is held
2) Changed the hotkey to P, you can change it in the source. do ctrl+f and look for the virtual key for P. 
3) Added a multiplier bar. I thought the sensitivity of it was way too low for what I play at, so the multiplier multiplies the movement of the recoil macro by whatever that number is. 
4) Added hotkeys F1 to lower the speed by 1, and F2 to raise it by 1. 
5) Changed default angle to 90

Note: Idk how the config save thing works, you can check the original code if you want to get it to work. I dont use it so its broken atm.

How to use:
- Press P to enable / disable the macro
- Only When Scoped In makes it so that when enabled, the macro only works when right click is held
- Speed determines the severity of the recoil control
- Multiplier multiplies the speed number
- Angle is the angle at which is controls the recoil, 90 default for down.
- Config system doesnt work in this version I made, and I dont use it so I wont be adding it.
